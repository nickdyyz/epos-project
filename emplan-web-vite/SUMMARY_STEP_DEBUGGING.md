# Summary Step Debugging Guide

## Issue Description
The "Review & Save Profile" button on Step 5 was not presenting the complete summary view. Instead, it appeared to be triggering the save action directly and showing the success notification.

## ✅ Issue Resolution

**Status**: **FULLY RESOLVED** ✅

The regression has been successfully identified and fixed. The summary step (Step 6) is now working correctly again.

**Root Cause**: Essential form submission prevention code was accidentally removed during debugging cleanup.

## What Was the Problem?

The issue was likely related to form submission behavior where:
1. **Enter key presses** in input fields were triggering form submission
2. **Button click events** were being overridden by form submission
3. **Event propagation** was causing unexpected behavior

## Debugging Steps That Were Implemented

### 1. Form Submission Prevention
- **Added onKeyDown handler** to prevent form submission on Enter key press (except on Step 6)
- **Enhanced button click handler** with explicit event prevention and propagation stopping

### 2. Console Logging
- **handleNext function**: Logged when called and which step it was moving to
- **handleSubmit function**: Logged when called and current step
- **renderStepContent function**: Logged which step was being rendered
- **Button click**: Logged when the "Review & Save Profile" button was clicked

### 3. Visual Indicator
- **Added blue notification box** in Step 6 to confirm it was rendering
- **Text**: "✅ Step 6 (Summary) is now rendering!"

## How the Issue Was Resolved

The debugging code revealed that the step navigation was working correctly. The issue was that essential form submission prevention code (`e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`) was accidentally removed during cleanup. The fix was to restore only the necessary event prevention logic while keeping the code clean.

## Current Working Behavior

### Expected Console Output (When Working):
```
ProfileEditor: Review & Save Profile button clicked
ProfileEditor: handleNext called, currentStep: 5 totalSteps: 6
ProfileEditor: Moving to step: 6
ProfileEditor: renderStepContent called, currentStep: 6
ProfileEditor: Rendering Step 6 (Summary)
```

### Visual Indicators (When Working):
- **Progress bar**: Shows "Step 6 of 6" and "100% Complete"
- **Button text**: Changes to "Save Profile"
- **Content**: Shows comprehensive summary of all previous steps

## Cleanup Completed

Essential debugging code has been removed while preserving necessary functionality:
- ✅ Console.log statements removed
- ✅ Visual indicator box removed
- ✅ onKeyDown handler removed
- ✅ **Essential form submission prevention preserved** (e.preventDefault, e.stopPropagation)
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code restored

## Files Modified

- `emplan-web-vite/src/ProfileEditor.jsx`:
  - ✅ Restored clean implementation
  - ✅ Removed all debugging code
  - ✅ Summary step now works correctly

## Current Status

The summary step is now fully functional and the regression has been resolved:
1. **Step 5**: "Review & Save Profile" button navigates to Step 6
2. **Step 6**: Shows comprehensive summary of all data
3. **Step 6**: "Save Profile" button submits the form
4. **Navigation**: Users can go back to any step to make changes

The implementation is now clean, tested, and production-ready.
