# Country List Expansion Report

## Issue
The country selection in Step 3 "Location Information" was initially restricted to only Canada and United States, which was too limiting for a global application.

## Solution
Expanded the country dropdown to include a comprehensive list of 180+ countries while excluding those on export control and banned lists.

## Implementation

### 1. New Countries Data File
**File:** `emplan-web-vite/src/data/countries.js`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive list of 180+ countries and territories
- Excludes countries on export control lists (e.g., North Korea, Iran)
- Alphabetically sorted for easy navigation
- ISO country codes for future API integration
- Helper functions for country-specific formatting

### 2. Excluded Countries
The following countries are **intentionally excluded** due to export control and trade restrictions:
- **North Korea** (DPRK) - Comprehensive sanctions
- **Iran** - Export control restrictions
- **Cuba** - Trade embargo restrictions
- **Syria** - Export control restrictions
- **Venezuela** - Certain trade restrictions
- **Russia** - Current sanctions and restrictions

### 3. Helper Functions
**`usesZipCode(countryName)`**
- Returns `true` for United States
- Returns `false` for all other countries (which use postal codes)

**`getPostalCodePlaceholder(countryName)`**
- Returns appropriate placeholder text based on country
- Examples:
  - United States: "12345"
  - Canada: "A1A 1A1"
  - United Kingdom: "SW1A 1AA"
  - Germany: "12345"
  - France: "75001"
  - Australia: "2000"
  - Japan: "100-0001"
  - Brazil: "12345-678"
  - India: "110001"

**`getCountryName(code)`**
- Converts ISO country code to country name
- Useful for API integration

**`getCountryCode(name)`**
- Converts country name to ISO country code
- Useful for API integration

### 4. Updated Components

#### Onboarding.jsx
**Changes:**
- Imported `COUNTRIES`, `usesZipCode`, `getPostalCodePlaceholder`
- Updated country dropdown to use comprehensive list
- Dynamic field labels based on country selection
- Region-appropriate placeholders

#### ProfileEditor.jsx
**Changes:**
- Same updates as Onboarding.jsx
- Consistent behavior across both components

### 5. Dynamic Field Behavior

#### Postal Code vs Zip Code
- **United States:** Shows "Zip Code *" with placeholder "12345"
- **All Other Countries:** Shows "Postal Code *" with region-appropriate placeholder

#### Placeholder Examples by Region
- **North America:** Canada (A1A 1A1), Mexico (12345)
- **Europe:** UK (SW1A 1AA), Germany (12345), France (75001)
- **Asia-Pacific:** Japan (100-0001), Australia (2000), India (110001)
- **South America:** Brazil (12345-678), Argentina (1234)
- **Africa:** South Africa (1234), Egypt (12345)

## Technical Details

### Country Data Structure
```javascript
{
  code: 'US',        // ISO 2-letter country code
  name: 'United States'  // Full country name
}
```

### Integration Pattern
```javascript
import { COUNTRIES, usesZipCode, getPostalCodePlaceholder } from './data/countries';

// In component
{COUNTRIES.map((country) => (
  <option key={country.code} value={country.name}>
    {country.name}
  </option>
))}

// Dynamic labels
{usesZipCode(formData.country) ? 'Zip Code *' : 'Postal Code *'}

// Dynamic placeholders
placeholder={getPostalCodePlaceholder(formData.country)}
```

## Compliance and Legal Considerations
