# Industry Regression Fix - "Other" Organization Type

## üêõ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem:** When users selected "Other" for Organization Type, the industry selection dropdown was not appearing, causing a regression in functionality.

**Root Cause:** The `getIndustryOptions()` function in `industryClassifications.js` was looking for `INDUSTRY_CLASSIFICATIONS[organizationType]`, but there was no entry for "Other" organization type in the classifications object.

## üîß **FIX IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Added "Other" Organization Type to Industry Classifications**

**File:** `emplan-web-vite/src/data/industryClassifications.js`

**Added new classification:**
```javascript
Other: {
  label: "Other Organizations",
  description: "Industry classifications for other organization types",
  categories: [
    {
      code: "OTHER",
      description: "Other",
      subcategories: [
        { code: "OTHER", description: "Other Industry" }
      ]
    },
    {
      code: "81",
      description: "Other Services (except Public Administration)",
      subcategories: [...]
    },
    {
      code: "92",
      description: "Public Administration",
      subcategories: [...]
    },
    {
      code: "51",
      description: "Information",
      subcategories: [...]
    },
    {
      code: "54",
      description: "Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services",
      subcategories: [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Industry Options Available for "Other" Organization Type**

**Available Industries:**
- **Other** - Custom industry input field
- **Other Services (except Public Administration)** - Standard NAICS 81
- **Public Administration** - Standard NAICS 92
- **Information** - Standard NAICS 51
- **Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services** - Standard NAICS 54

## ‚úÖ **FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED**

### **User Experience Flow**
```
1. User selects "Other" for Organization Type
2. Custom organization type field appears (optional)
3. Industry selection dropdown appears with options
4. User can select standard industry OR "Other"
5. If "Other" industry selected, custom industry field appears
6. User can proceed with any combination of selections
```

### **Validation Rules Maintained**
- **Organization Type "Other":** Industry selection is optional
- **Industry "Other":** Custom industry field is optional
- **Both "Other" Options:** Work independently and are both optional

## üß™ **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Organization Type "Other" with Standard Industry**
```
Organization Type: Other
Custom Organization Type: [optional]
Industry: Information (NAICS 51)
Subcategory: Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services (NAICS 518)
Result: ‚úÖ Industry selection works
```

### **Scenario 2: Organization Type "Other" with "Other" Industry**
```
Organization Type: Other
Custom Organization Type: [optional]
Industry: Other
Custom Industry: Blockchain Technology
Result: ‚úÖ Both custom fields work independently
```

### **Scenario 3: Organization Type "Other" with No Industry**
```
Organization Type: Other
Custom Organization Type: [optional]
Industry: [not selected]
Result: ‚úÖ User can proceed (industry is optional for "Other" org type)
```

## üìä **DATA STRUCTURE EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: "Other" Organization Type with Standard Industry**
```json
{
  "organizationType": "Other",
  "customOrganizationType": "Cooperative",
  "industry": "51",
  "naicsCode": "518",
  "naicsDescription": "Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services",
  "customIndustry": ""
}
```

### **Example 2: "Other" Organization Type with "Other" Industry**
```json
{
  "organizationType": "Other",
  "customOrganizationType": "Foundation",
  "industry": "OTHER",
  "naicsCode": "OTHER",
  "naicsDescription": "Other",
  "customIndustry": "Digital Currency"
}
```

### **Example 3: "Other" Organization Type with No Industry**
```json
{
  "organizationType": "Other",
  "customOrganizationType": "Association",
  "industry": "",
  "naicsCode": "",
  "naicsDescription": "",
  "customIndustry": ""
}
```

## üîÑ **COMPONENT LOGIC VERIFICATION**

### **OrganizationTypeSelector Component**
- **Conditional Rendering:** `{value && industryOptions.length > 0 && (...)}`
- **Industry Options:** Now properly populated for "Other" organization type
- **Custom Fields:** Both organization type and industry custom fields work independently
- **Validation:** Maintains optional nature of custom fields

### **Data Flow**
1. User selects "Other" for organization type
2. `useEffect` triggers with `value = "Other"`
3. `getIndustryOptions("Other")` returns industry categories
4. `industryOptions.length > 0` evaluates to `true`
5. Industry selection section renders
6. User can select industry or "Other" for custom input
