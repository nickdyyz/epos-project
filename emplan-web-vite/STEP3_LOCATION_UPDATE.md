# Step 3 "Location Information" Update Report

## Overview
Updated Step 3 "Location Information" in both the Onboarding and ProfileEditor components to enhance the user experience with improved address handling, autocomplete functionality, and dynamic field labels based on country selection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Subtitle
**Before:** "Where is your primary location?" / "Where is your organization located?"
**After:** "What is the primary operational location"

**Files Modified:**
- `emplan-web-vite/src/Onboarding.jsx`
- `emplan-web-vite/src/ProfileEditor.jsx`

### 2. Enhanced Address Field
**Changes:**
- Made the primary address field **optional** (removed required asterisk)
- Added autocomplete functionality with common address suggestions
- Updated placeholder text to clarify that users can leave it blank for city-only information

**New Component:** `emplan-web-vite/src/components/AddressAutocomplete.jsx`

**Features:**
- Basic autocomplete with common address patterns
- Dropdown suggestions that appear after typing 2+ characters
- Click-to-select functionality
- Keyboard navigation support
- Click-outside-to-close behavior
- Responsive design with proper z-index layering

### 3. Dynamic Field Labels
**Postal Code / Zip Code:**
- **United States:** Shows "Zip Code *" with placeholder "12345"
- **Other Countries:** Shows "Postal Code *" with region-appropriate placeholders
- **Dynamic:** Label and placeholder change based on selected country

**Regional Placeholders:**
- Canada: "A1A 1A1"

- Germany: "12345"
- France: "75001"
- Australia: "2000"

- And many more...

### 4. Country Selection
**Changes:**
- Converted from free-text input to dropdown select
- Added required validation
- Comprehensive list of 180+ countries excluding export control and banned countries
- Made country selection mandatory for form validation

**Coverage:**
- Includes all major countries and territories
- Excludes countries on export control lists (e.g., North Korea, Iran)
- Alphabetically sorted for easy navigation
- Supports international address formats

**New File:** `emplan-web-vite/src/data/countries.js`

### 5. Updated Validation Logic
**Before:** Required primary address
**After:** 
- Primary address is optional
- **City is always required**
- **State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, and Country are conditional:**
  - **Required** when primary address is provided
  - **Optional** when only city information is provided (city-only mode)

**Validation Rules:**
```javascript
case 3:
  // City is always required
  if (!formData.city) return false;
  
  // If primary address is provided, then state, zip/postal code, and country are required
  if (formData.primaryAddress) {
    return formData.state && formData.zipCode && formData.country;
  }
  
  // If no primary address, only city is required (city-only mode)
  return true;
```

**Dynamic Field Labels:**
- **When primary address is provided:** All fields show "*" (required)
- **When primary address is empty:** State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, and Country show "(Optional)"

## Technical Implementation

### AddressAutocomplete Component
**Location:** `emplan-web-vite/src/components/AddressAutocomplete.jsx`

**Features:**

- Accessibility considerations

**Props:**

```

**Usage:**
```jsx

  value={formData.primaryAddress}
  onChange={handleInputChange}
  placeholder="Enter specific address or leave blank for city-only"
/>
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Flexibility
- Users can now provide either a specific address OR just city information

### 2. Autocomplete
- Provides helpful suggestions as users type
- Reduces typing errors
- Improves data quality and consistency

### 3. Context-Aware Labels

## Future Enhancements
