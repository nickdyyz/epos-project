- **Uppercase letters** requirement  
- **Numbers** requirement
- **Special characters** requirement
- **Real-time strength indicator** with color-coded progress bar
- **Detailed feedback** showing missing requirements

#### Security Features
- **Password obfuscation** with show/hide toggle
- **Auto-complete disabled** for security
- **No password storage** in form state or localStorage
- **Real-time validation** with immediate feedback
- **Professional UI** with clear security reminders

### 2. Form Integration
Updated the EnhancedPlanForm to include password functionality:

#### Form State Updates

- Integrated password validation into form validation
- Added password field to review step
- Updated FORM_STEPS to include password requirement

#### Review Step Enhancement
- **PDF Security Section** with clear instructions
- **Password input field** with strength validation
- **Security reminders** about password management
- **Professional styling** with yellow warning colors

### 3. API Integration
Enhanced the plan generation API to handle password protection:

#### Password Validation
- **Server-side validation** of password strength
- **Comprehensive error messages** for each requirement
- **Security checks** before plan generation
- **Password redaction** from logs and responses

#### PDF Generation
- **Password-protected PDF creation** using PyPDF2
- **Secure password handling** throughout the process
- **PDF path inclusion** in API response
- **Memory cleanup** for security

### 4. Security Implementation
Implemented comprehensive security measures:

#### Password Handling
- **Never stored** in database or logs
- **Redacted from memory** after use
- **Not included** in API responses
- **Secure transmission** only during generation

#### PDF Protection
- **PyPDF2 encryption** for password protection
- **Professional PDF formatting** with organization name
- **Temporary file handling** for security
- **Cleanup procedures** to remove sensitive data

## Technical Implementation
