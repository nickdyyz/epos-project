# Progressive Building Display Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the multi-building feature to implement progressive disclosure, ensuring that additional building options are only shown when the user has provided information for the previous building. This prevents UI clutter and creates a more intuitive, step-by-step experience.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: All additional building options (Buildings 2-5) were displayed simultaneously when the building information section was expanded, creating a cluttered interface.

**After**: Additional buildings appear progressively based on user input, showing only the next building option after the user has added information to the previous one.

## Implementation

### Progressive Display Logic
```javascript
{/* Additional Buildings - Progressive Display */}
{showBuildingInfo && (
  <>
    {/* Show Building 2 if primary building has some data */}
    {(formData.buildingType || formData.numberOfFloors || formData.buildingAge || formData.totalSquareFootage) && 
      renderAdditionalBuilding(2, showBuilding2, setShowBuilding2, handleShowBuilding2)
    }
    
    {/* Show Building 3 if Building 2 has some data */}
    {((formData.building2Name || formData.building2Type || formData.building2Floors || formData.building2Age || formData.building2SquareFootage) || showBuilding2) && 
      renderAdditionalBuilding(3, showBuilding3, setShowBuilding3, handleShowBuilding3)
    }
    
    {/* Show Building 4 if Building 3 has some data */}
    {((formData.building3Name || formData.building3Type || formData.building3Floors || formData.building3Age || formData.building3SquareFootage) || showBuilding3) && 
      renderAdditionalBuilding(4, showBuilding4, setShowBuilding4, handleShowBuilding4)
    }
    
    {/* Show Building 5 if Building 4 has some data */}
    {((formData.building4Name || formData.building4Type || formData.building4Floors || formData.building4Age || formData.building4SquareFootage) || showBuilding4) && 
      renderAdditionalBuilding(5, showBuilding5, setShowBuilding5, handleShowBuilding5)
    }
  </>
)}
```

### Display Conditions

#### Building 2
- **Trigger**: Primary building has at least one field filled
- **Fields Checked**: `buildingType`, `numberOfFloors`, `buildingAge`, `totalSquareFootage`
- **Logic**: Any of these fields has a value

#### Building 3
- **Trigger**: Building 2 has data OR Building 2 section is expanded
- **Fields Checked**: `building2Name`, `building2Type`, `building2Floors`, `building2Age`, `building2SquareFootage`
- **Logic**: Any field has data OR `showBuilding2` is true

#### Building 4
- **Trigger**: Building 3 has data OR Building 3 section is expanded
- **Fields Checked**: `building3Name`, `building3Type`, `building3Floors`, `building3Age`, `building3SquareFootage`
- **Logic**: Any field has data OR `showBuilding3` is true

#### Building 5
- **Trigger**: Building 4 has data OR Building 4 section is expanded
- **Fields Checked**: `building4Name`, `building4Type`, `building4Floors`, `building4Age`, `building4SquareFootage`
- **Logic**: Any field has data OR `showBuilding4` is true

## User Experience Flow

### Progressive Building Addition
1. **Primary Building**: User expands building information section
2. **Building 2**: Appears only after user enters data in primary building
3. **Building 3**: Appears only after user enters data in Building 2
4. **Building 4**: Appears only after user enters data in Building 3
5. **Building 5**: Appears only after user enters data in Building 4

### Interaction Patterns
- **Clean Interface**: Only relevant building options are visible
- **Guided Progression**: Users are naturally guided through building addition
- **Flexible Input**: Users can still skip buildings if needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Next building option appears as soon as data is entered

## Technical Implementation

### Conditional Rendering
- **Data-Driven Display**: Building options appear based on actual data presence
- **State-Aware Logic**: Considers both data presence and UI state
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows building option if section is expanded (even without data)

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced DOM Elements**: Fewer elements rendered when not needed
- **Cleaner Interface**: Less visual clutter for users
- **Focused Experience**: Users see only relevant options

## Files Updated
- `emplan-web-vite/src/Onboarding.jsx`: Progressive display logic for onboarding
- `emplan-web-vite/src/ProfileEditor.jsx`: Progressive display logic for profile editing

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users see only relevant options
- **Guided Workflow**: Natural progression through building addition
- **Clean Interface**: No overwhelming list of building options
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Progressive disclosure matches user expectations

### Interface Design
- **Minimal Clutter**: Only necessary UI elements are displayed
- **Focused Attention**: Users can concentrate on current building
- **Scalable Design**: Works well for organizations with any number of buildings
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established progressive disclosure patterns

### Data Quality
- **Intentional Addition**: Users only add buildings they actually need
- **Complete Information**: Encourages filling out building data before adding more
- **Logical Flow**: Buildings are added in a logical sequence

## Edge Cases Handled

### Partial Data
- **Some Fields Filled**: Building option appears if any field has data
- **Empty Sections**: Building option appears if section is expanded
- **Mixed States**: Handles combinations of data and UI state

### User Behavior
- **Skip Buildings**: Users can expand a building section without adding data
- **Go Back**: Users can return to previous buildings to add more data
- **Remove Data**: Building options disappear if all data is cleared

## Testing Scenarios

### Progressive Addition
- **Single Building**: Only primary building visible initially
- **Two Buildings**: Building 2 appears after primary building data
- **Multiple Buildings**: Each building appears sequentially
- **Maximum Buildings**: All 5 buildings available through progression

### Data Management
- **Add Data**: Next building option appears
- **Remove Data**: Building options disappear appropriately
- **Partial Data**: Building options remain visible
- **Clear All**: Return to initial state

### UI States
- **Expand/Collapse**: Building options respect section visibility
- **Form Validation**: Progressive display works with validation
- **Error States**: Building options remain accessible during errors

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Smart Detection**: More sophisticated logic for determining when to show next building
- **User Preferences**: Remember user's preferred number of buildings
- **Bulk Operations**: Allow adding multiple buildings at once for power users
- **Template Buildings**: Pre-filled building templates for common types

### Scalability
- **Dynamic Limits**: Allow more than 5 buildings with progressive display
- **Building Categories**: Group buildings by type or location
- **Advanced Logic**: More complex conditions for showing building options

## Conclusion

The progressive building display enhancement significantly improves the user experience by reducing interface clutter and providing a guided, intuitive workflow for adding multiple buildings. The implementation maintains flexibility while ensuring users only see relevant options, creating a cleaner and more focused interface.

This enhancement follows established UX patterns for progressive disclosure and provides a solid foundation for future multi-building management features.
