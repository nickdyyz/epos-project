Section 2. UBC Vancouver Community Profile
This plan recognizes UBC Vancouver (UBCV) is situated on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of
the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam). The plan is guided by UBC’s commitment to implement the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People Act – the roadmap for transforming the intent of reconciliation
into action can be found in UBC’s Indigenous Strategic Plan (ISP).


The UBC Vancouver Campus

UBCV has an overnight population of over 30,000 (including the University Neighbourhoods Association) and
is the largest university in the country by overnight population, and the third largest by enrolment. When in
session, the day-time population reaches nearly 100,000, which is larger than many British Columba cities.

The campus sits within the Metro Vancouver Regional District’s (MVRD) Electoral Area A on 400 hectares
located at the western tip of the Point Grey Peninsula surrounded by forest and ocean consisting of
academic/institutional facilities, student housing, residential housing in addition to retail shops, recreational
amenities, and a hospital. The University manages its own municipal services, including energy and water
infrastructure, and operates as the largest daycare provider in British Columbia. The campus is geographically
isolated with limited transportation access routes. UBC Vancouver is the largest non-municipal community in
Canada and, unlike all other post-secondary institutions, is not supported by any municipal emergency
management infrastructure.

The area hazards include earthquakes, extreme weather events, and the potential threat of urban and wildland
fires necessitating comprehensive emergency and disaster preparedness measures, including the provision of
mass care services. During emergencies, the Vancouver campus is a refuge and has played host to evacuees
from disaster affected areas outside its community.

University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA)
The Neighbourhood housing areas consist of five densely populated neighbourhoods, totaling 13,000
residents. These communities are not part of UBC’s student housing infrastructure. From south to north they
are:

          Wesbrook Place;
          Hampton Place;
          Hawthorn Place;
          East Campus, and
          Chancellor Place.

UNA contains a mix of property types, including townhouses, low-rise and high-rise buildings (up to 22 storeys)
and commercial and community centres located in Wesbrook Place and Hawthorn Place. UNA is a society
incorporated under the BC Societies Act. It is not a local government and has no authority other than that
delegated to it by UBC as per the Neighbours Agreement 2024; it relies on UBC for emergency management
planning and services.

Section 3. Plan Overview
Introduction

The UBCV EMP documents the framework that UBCV will use to prepare for, respond to and recover from
emergencies and disasters.

UBCV recognizes that, in times of emergencies, our community partners may seek assistance, support and
possibly refuge within the campus area. Therefore, we must be prepared to manage large-scale complex
emergencies where more than our students, faculty, and staff are impacted. This level of preparation requires
collaborative, multi-jurisdictional planning with engagement from the whole UBCV community.


Purpose

Designed to be functional and executable, the UBCV EMP will enable staff, faculty, and their emergency
management partners, to deal with a broad spectrum of emergencies, incidents, and disruptions. Through
preparation and planning for various types of emergencies, the University can protect the safety and wellbeing
of the UBCV community.

This plan is intended to:

          provide guidance for response and coordination in the event of a disaster;
          establish the incident response system and stakeholder partnerships for clear communication;
          outline roles and responsibilities in the event of an emergency.


Scope

The UBCV EMP applies to the Point Grey campus including the UNA, and UBC Robson Square; the UBC
facilities located at the Learning Exchange and other satellite UBCV sites will coordinate their emergency
requirements through the UBCV Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and their respective faculties and
departments.

Emergency Response Priorities

UBCV’s emergency response priorities are to:

    1.   Provide for the safety and health of all responders.
    2.   Save lives.
    3.   Reduce suffering.
    4.   Protect public health.
    5.   Protect infrastructure.
    6.   Protect property.
    7.   Protect the environment.
    8.   Reduce economic and social losses.

These priorities are issued to support decision making through the response. These priorities adhere to those
established by the Government of British Columbia as outlined in the British Columbia Emergency
Management System 2016 (BCEMS).


Cultural Safety Considerations Intersectional Disadvantage and
Vulnerability

The UBCV EMP is guided by UBC’s commitment to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous People Act and by its Indigenous Strategic Plan (ISP) which lays out the roadmap for
transforming the intent of reconciliation into action.

The UBCV EMP is also guided by UBC’s commitment to inclusion as set out in the Inclusion Action Plan (IAP)
which is grounded in UBCV’s location on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Musqueam and
recognizes Indigenous people and Indigenous concerns.

The Vancouver campus risk assessments, consider the potential consequences of emergencies for those
experiencing intersectional disadvantage and vulnerability.

Authority for this Plan

The public post-secondary sector is governed by two key pieces of legislation: The University Act and the
College and Institute Act.

Under the Workers Compensation Act, Part 2 Occupational Health and Safety, and the Occupational
Health and Safety Regulation, UBC is required to have an emergency program.
Under the Emergency and Disaster Management Act (EDMA), UBC is required to have an emergency
management plan.

The authority for emergency management planning, response and recovery is established by the following
UBC policies and all relevant legislation including but not limited to:

          UBC policy Health & Safety (SC01)
          UBC policy Disaster Management (SC10)

The overall authority for emergency and continuity response rests with the UBC President or designate. UBC
has a Crisis Management Team (CMT) comprised of UBC’s executive members and this team, when activated,
is responsible for, and has the authority to make, strategic, financial, and policy decisions for UBC during an
emergency.

In the event the UBC President is not available when an incident occurs, the line of succession is detailed in
UBC policy Acting President (GA1).

External Agencies

Provincial and Federal Agency Support
The Province will coordinate available resources to provide emergency response assistance that supplements
but does not substitute existing internal resources or resources available within the broader community. The

Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness (EMCR) coordinates provincial support through
the Emergency Coordination Centre (ECC), Provincial Regional Emergency Operations Centre (PREOCs),
and/or Provincial Emergency Coordination Centre (PECC), if activated, and leads all engagement with federal
agencies on behalf of the Province. The Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills (PSFS) can
liaise with EMCR to support Post-Secondary Institutions (PSIs); PSIs should attempt to work through local
authorities first. PSFS can also support PSIs in liaising with other provincial ministries.

 Agency              Roles and Responsibilities
 Local Authority     Establishes and maintains an emergency management support organization.

                     Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD) is UBCV’s local authority and they have the
                     authority to declare a State of Local Emergency and a Declared Recovery Period when
                     requested by UBCV.

                     Appoints committees and a coordinator for the emergency management organization – can

Section 5. Mitigation
Mitigation measures are those undertaken for the purpose of identifying and removing or reducing hazards to
prevent emergencies from occurring or reduce the scale, scope, and adverse effects of an emergency, where
possible. UBC has several plans and strategies to improve mitigation efforts across campuses.

Mitigations Measures

 Business Continuity                   UBC has a policy (Disaster Management Policy SC10) that governs
                                       continuity of services which requires all university administrative and
                                       academic units to develop and maintain unit-based business continuity
                                       plans and procedures, and to test their business continuity plans applicable
                                       to the activities and operations of their unit. The program is managed by
                                       SRS who assists units to develop strategies for the following scenarios:
                                             disruption of information technology services;
                                             workplace disruption;
                                             workforce disruption;
                                             supply chain disruption.
 Insurance                             UBC has a comprehensive insurance program managed by SRS that
                                       provides risk management expertise to all university units ensuring
                                       adequate insurance coverage for UBC’s assets as well as handling
                                       premiums, deductibles, and claims.
 Seismic Resilience Plan               Since 2016 UBC has been working to improve seismic resilience on the
                                       Vancouver campus with a view to life safety and re-occupancy within
                                       financial and logistical constraints by looking holistically at all buildings as
                                       well as utilities, emergency preparedness and continuity. Progress
                                       continues on this work according to the outlined priorities.
 UBC Climate Emergency Declaration     UBC has a Climate Emergency Declaration that recognizes the severity,
                                       complexity, and disproportionate impacts of, and responsibilities for, the
                                       climate crisis. It commits UBC to develop a collective response that
                                       embeds climate justice throughout its activities and priorities. The
                                       Declaration gives impetus for UBC to update plans to address the climate
                                       crisis with the urgency it requires.
 UBC Climate Action Plan 2030          The UBC Climate Action Plan 2030 (CAP 2030) is a UBC-wide effort
                                       across both Vancouver and Okanagan campuses that focuses on the
                                       development of mitigation strategies to reduce fossil fuel impacts and
                                       respond to climate change. The CAP is accompanied by an accountability
                                       framework that outlines responsibilities for implementation, monitoring
                                       progress, and governance for decision-making over time.
 Adaptation, Resilience and            UBC is developing a Climate Adaptation, Resiliency and Biodiversity
 Biodiversity                          Strategy that is an "umbrella" strategy incorporating other UBC plans,
                                       policies and initiatives, with specific actions to maintain and enhance urban
                                       biodiversity as a tool for climate action through nature-based solutions.

Section 6. Preparedness
Preparedness measures are those undertaken for the purpose of establishing the knowledge, capability, and
capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from the adverse effects of an emergency.


Public Notification and Information

There is a variety of ways by which safety information is provided to the community. The right tool depends on
the type, location and scale of the incident. It is recommended that community members sign up and download
multiple or all of these to stay informed during an emergency.




UBC Alert is the university’s mass notification system that sends alerts in situations that pose an immediate
safety or security risks local to the UBC campus and community (update your primary contact information in
Workday to receive notifications).

The ubc.ca website is the source of information for campus communities to stay up-to-date as the incident
progresses. The ubc.ca website can be amplified on social media (back up from UBC Okanagan).

UBC Safe Vancouver app is a free mobile safety app for UBC Vancouver (recommended for UBC students,
faculty, staff and campus visitors) that offers access to campus safety resources and sends alerts and push
notifications (push notifications must be turned on to receive timely updates and urgent notifications, e.g.,
weather advisories, class cancellations, etc.).

  March 2025 | Version One
Alertable is MVRD’s free downloadable mass public alert system to help people in Electoral Area A
(UBCV/UNA) stay informed and safe during an emergency in the region.

NPAS is Canada’s National Public Alerting System (also known as Alert Ready) which provides emergency
management organizations across the country with the capability to rapidly warn the public of imminent or
unfolding hazards to life. Registration is not required. Public alerts are issued through radio, cable and satellite
television and on compatible wireless devices. The Earthquake Early Warning System alerts are also sent out
using this system. It is designed to send out tens-of-seconds of warning by detecting an earthquake
immediately as it occurs. Recipients should assume shaking is imminent.


Subsidiary Plans

All of the UBCV capability and hazard-based plans are developed from a risk-based approach to address
emergency preparedness and response (see List of Annexes on page 45).




  UBC Vancouver Emergency Management Plan                                                                  Page 18 of 38

Training, Exercise and Engagement Program

Training and Exercise
UBCV provides emergency management training and education for the community, as well as coordinating
campus‐wide activities to exercise and test emergency and disaster response. Key groups who make up
response and recovery functions (e.g., Student Housing and Community Services, Facilities, UNA) are
targeted. Examples of training provided include:

          EOC Essentials;
          Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA);
          Mass Care - Reception Centre, Group Lodging.

Exercising is conducted to test and evaluate roles, responsibilities, processes, procedures, plans and priorities.
Documented exercise outcomes form part of the continuous planning cycle. At a minimum, exercises are
conducted annually either entirely or through using specific operational, planning or logistic aspects.

Engagement
UBCV promotes personal and institutional preparedness and readiness through a variety of annual events
such as Great BC ShakeOut, Ready Week, Emergency Preparedness Week, and UNA Neighbours Day, and
participates in adjacent community emergency events and exercises wherever possible.


Hazards, Risk and Vulnerabilities (HRVA)

The purpose of a Hazard, Risk, and Vulnerability Analysis (HRVA) is to help UBCV make risk-based choices to
address vulnerability, mitigate hazards, and prepare for response and recovery from disasters. Such risk
assessments must be prepared in accordance with EDMA and regulations. UBCV uses the list of Analyzed
Regional Hazards with the Greatest Potential Impact to Metro Vancouver, which the Integrated Partnership for
Regional Emergency Management (IPREM) compiled following a series of stakeholder workshops, and Metro
Vancouver’s key hazards and risk which for the Vancouver campus includes:
      1. Earthquake
      2. Extreme weather
      3. Flooding
      4. Urban and wildland wildfires
      5. Landslides
A specific hazard identification risk assessment for UBCV is currently in progress.


Infrastructure and Supplies

Emergency preparedness infrastructure on the Vancouver campus is being made resilient with ongoing
projects that focus on emergency readiness. These include but are not limited to: potable water wells, fuel
resilience, emergency generator power, and radio infrastructure redundancy.

UBC Vancouver also maintains a sizable inventory of emergency supplies to support the campus post-disaster.




  UBC Vancouver Emergency Management Plan                                                                Page 19 of 38

Section 7. British Columbia Emergency
Management System
The British Columbia Emergency Management System (BCEMS) is a comprehensive framework that helps
ensure a coordinated and organized approach to emergencies and disasters. It provides a structure for a
standardized approach to developing, coordinating, and implementing emergency management programs
across the province.

In 2016 BCEMS was introduced to incorporate the four phases of emergency management. BCEMS views
emergency management as a continuous process consisting of four interconnected phases: mitigation,
preparedness, response, and recovery.

  March 2025 | Version One
Section 8. UBCV’s Response Organization
UBCV’s response organization primarily operates at a site (i.e., specific buildings or facilities) and site support
(i.e., EOC or DOC) levels within the provincial organizational structure.

An incident may escalate over time, or as additional information becomes available; the response structure is
flexible and scalable to support the response as required.


Response Phases

The Province leads the coordination of response and recovery activities with local, provincial, First Nations,
national and international emergency partners, following a catastrophic event. The response to an event
consists of two phases: immediate and sustained response. It is important to note that while there is no overlap
in the immediate and sustained response, there can be overlap in the response and recovery phases.
Recovery can start during the response phase and can continue for years beyond the conclusion of the
response.

Immediate Response In the first hours or days following an emergency event, the immediate response priority
is to save lives, provide emergency support services and mass care, obtain and share situational awareness,
restore critical infrastructure and set conditions for a sustained, coordinated response and recovery effort.

Sustained Response Once the immediate response phase ends, a PSI may be closed or used to support
other response efforts, e.g., provide space for a reception centre, group lodging and/or resource staging areas.
Requests for PSI resources could come from the Province; however, it is expected that most would come from
local authorities.

Once a resource has been requested, the PSI will support the request and may consult with PSFS for
additional support. PSFS will work with impacted PSIs if required, to monitor compensation for eligible claims.

Figure 1 – UBCV Response Structures




Incident Classification

Routine incidents are those that happen on campus regularly, with a well-defined scope, and where duration
and impacts are understood. Typically, these incidents are handled through normal response procedures, i.e.,
department-based procedures and/or emergency response plan(s). Routine incidents may be managed by a
single lead department or multiple departments working together. This could be through normal operational
roles or through incident management (i.e., DOC). Routine incidents do not require substantial additional
resources from other campus departments. The affected unit/department(s) may activate their continuity
plan(s) if deemed necessary or appropriate. Examples: short-term power outage, burst pipe.

Non-Routine incidents are those that have a significant impact on one or multiple campus departments and
require a coordinated response. Response is not within the normal scope of department activities and affected
departments cannot effectively manage these incidents without more intensive or longer response activities. An
Incident Management Team (IMT) is providing site-level support to DOCs. Notification to the Incident
Management Team or Executive on Call may be necessary, and activation of the EOC, either partially or fully,
may be required. Departmental business continuity plans may be insufficient at which point additional support
will be required. Examples: extended power outage, severe weather incident, hazardous substance release.

Major incidents include those where many, if not all, departments on campus are impacted; normal campus
operations are interrupted; response and recovery activities continue for an extended period, and routine


  UBC Vancouver Emergency Management Plan                                                            Page 22 of 38
  March 2025 | Version One
responses are insufficient, e.g., earthquake, interface wildfires. Major incidents will require EOC and/or CMT
activations. A major incident will generally require liaison with external partners such as MVRD, and/or the
PSFS. Affected unit(s)/department(s) may be directed to activate their DOC and continuity plan(s) with
centralized coordination occurring through the EOC.


Site Level

UBCV’s departmental response may include one or more DOCs, e.g., Campus Security, Facilities, Student
Housing and Community Services (SHCS) when unique functional support is required to support the
emergency to ensure regular business activities continue. First responders may set up an incident command
post to direct all site response activities by single or unified command, i.e., police, fire, and ambulance, if
deemed necessary or appropriate.


Supports to Site Level

An Incident Management Team (IMT) provides site-level support for coordinating operational stakeholders and
managing campus impacts from a DOC if operational. When institutional coordination is required, the EOC will
be activated either virtually, in-person or hybrid.


Campus Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)

The EOC supports and coordinates the emergency response activities within UBCV for a complex event that
requires coordination with a large number of stakeholders. The EOC is set up away from the incident site and
is normally activated at the request of the incident commander or the request of UBC’s senior leadership.

Through the EOC, UBCV:

          assesses the situation;
          provides support to incident command, and first responders, including resources;
          provides support and direction to UBCV employees;
          provides public information, including media briefings;
          coordinates response activities;
          liaises with Indigenous and local authorities, PSFS, EMCR, volunteer groups, and other external
           agencies;
          develops and distributes situation reports;
          submits resource requests when jurisdictional resources are exhausted or unable to fill the need;
          tracks finances;
          coordinates resumption of crucial services;
          coordinates recovery efforts.

EOC Communication and Information Management
Information sharing between the CMT and EOC/others will be via in person briefings, email, Signal app, Teams
channel and phone call, or other available communication methods as deemed appropriate based on the
situation and availability of each.

  March 2025 | Version One
UBCV has emergency communication plans/protocols that outline guidelines for quickly communicating during
an emergency with UBCV’s community and partners, as well as external stakeholders.


Crisis Management Team (CMT)

The UBC Executive Team activate the CMT when a crisis occurs that impacts reputational, strategic and/or
financial risks. They provide executive oversight and policy decision making for UBC as well as continuity of
critical functions in their respective areas of responsibilities.

When the EOC or an IMT is activated; this may include supporting the response structure with strategic
guidance. However, the CMT can be activated to deal with issues without a corresponding response structure
like an IMT or an EOC activation.


UBCV’s Response Structures-Initiation

UBCV’s response structures may be initiated, in whole or part, if an emergency has occurred or appears
imminent which may require action and coordination beyond normal response procedures. They may also be
initiated to assist in the planning and coordination of major planned events. The response structure selected is
based on the requirements for coordination between response partners and the impacts of the event to
campus activities.

A UBC-V emergency response does not necessarily imply the activation of an EOC. It could involve the use of
a DOC or an IMT response structure. The formal activation of an EOC occurs separately (see Annex C -
Emergency Response Playbook). EOC response activation may be requested by any senior leader of UBCV
which can be implemented by:

          Executive Director, Safety & Risk Services or designate;
          Director, Emergency Management and Business Continuity or designate.

Section 9. Recovery
Recovery is the phase of emergency management in which steps and processes are taken/implemented to:

         repair and rebuild UBCV’s functions and communities affected by a disaster;
         restore conditions to an acceptable level or, when feasible, improve them;
         restore self-sufficiency and increase resilience within the campus community.

UBCV’s recovery planning ensures the five aspects of recovery.


Five Aspects of Recovery

 Aspect                               Description
 Emotional and Psychological          Involves caring for the mental health of individuals who experienced or
 Recovery: Responding to Trauma       witnessed trauma from an emergency, disaster or critical incident.

                                      UBCV has internal services, programs, and resources in the event of a
                                      traumatic event as well as employee benefits programs.

                                      UBCV will normally have access to critical incident teams when a
                                      traumatic event occurs.

                                      Additional mental health support services will be added as required.
 Community and Cultural               Involves reopening campus attractions, cultural and community activities,
 Recovery                             and reunification of impacted populations to campus for teaching and
                                      learning purposes.

 Physical and Structural Recovery     UBCV may need to repair or rebuild structures and other infrastructure
                                      following a disaster.

                                      Delays in doing so could extend emotional impact.

 Business Continuity Planning         When there is significant disruption to UBCV operations, the
                                      unit/department Business Continuity Plan is activated to facilitate the
                                      continuation of critical/crucial services and functions following the initial
                                      emergency or threat.
 Restoration of Teaching and          Depending on the nature of the emergency, this may involve temporary
 Research                             arrangements and special accommodations to minimize disruption to
                                      learning, e.g., attending virtually.
 Debrief and After-Action Reviews     An opportunity to talk about the experience and gather vital information for
                                      planners.

                                      Debriefing is critical for those impacted by the emergency and those
                                      instrumental in the response.

Three Stages of Recovery

Recovery consists of three stages: short, medium and long-term, working towards minimizing future damage.
The diagram below illustrates possible recovery priorities during recovery stages. They are not all inclusive, or,
inclusive of community recovery aspects. There is no clear dividing line between response and recovery. It can
be more effective to initiate recovery efforts during response if it is possible to do so with available resources.
Recovery can take months or even years.

Various units may contribute to recovery efforts based on their expertise, mandate, and scope. For example,
UBC Facilities may oversee infrastructure-related tasks, such as conducting rapid damage assessments of
buildings within their purview, while Student Health Services may provide emotional and psychosocial support
to students.

  March 2025 | Version One
Section 10. Financial Considerations
Spending Authority

To support response and recovery actions, the Board of Governors has approved a Strategic Emergency
Resolution (Resolution Number 20 – Emergencies and Disasters) which provides various funding level
approvals, for both response and recovery operations.

The following persons can execute the spending on behalf of the University:

         Chair of the Board of Governors;
         Chancellor;
         President.
