Purpose
This procedure provides direction for responding to anonymous or digital threats made against the school to ensure the safety and security of students, faculty, staff, and visitors while minimizing disruption to school operations.
Procedure Statement
This procedure was developed to address threats made by anonymous or digital means, such as through email, social media, or phone calls, and to outline a systematic response framework that prioritizes safety and communication.

This procedure applies to any situation where the school is targeted by a threat communicated through anonymous or digital channels. It covers initial actions, threat assessment, communication, and escalation protocols.
Emergency Response Definitions
LEVEL 1 - General Awareness: A vague or non-specific threat where the credibility or severity is low but precautionary measures are required. Normal operations may continue while heightened awareness is maintained.
LEVEL 2 - Moderate Threat: A specific, credible threat requiring precautionary actions, such as securing the campus, implementing a hold-and-secure, or contacting law enforcement for support.
LEVEL 3 - Severe Threat: A highly credible or imminent threat requiring immediate lockdown or evacuation of the campus, initiated under law enforcement guidance.
Emergency Notification Procedure
Report: Any staff member who receives or becomes aware of a threat must immediately notify Campus Security and the Manager of Campus Safety.
Assess: Campus Security will assess the threat's credibility with input from law enforcement and IT Services (for digital threats).
Activate Response: Based on the assessment, the Manager of Campus Safety will implement the appropriate response level and notify the Executive Leadership Team.
Communicate: Approved notifications will be sent to staff, students, and parents through the schoolâ€™s communication system.
