Introduction
Ridley College’s mission is to prepare students for meaningful and flourishing lives by instilling
the values necessary for leadership in a global society. Central to this mission is our
commitment to creating a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment where all members of
our community can thrive.

The Ridley College Emergency Response Plan (ERP) serves as a flexible framework to ensure
preparedness in managing exceptional circumstances and emergency situations. This plan
reflects our dedication to safeguarding the well-being of our community, protecting our
operations and facilities, and minimizing disruptions that may impact our ability to fulfill our
mission.

The ERP outlines the roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols required to
effectively address risks, allocate resources, and ensure coordination during emergencies. It is a
critical reference that reflects the College’s commitment to service and care, empowering our
community to respond confidently and compassionately in times of need.


Approach
Ridley College’s Emergency Management Program incorporates prevention, mitigation,
preparedness, response, and recovery to ensure a unified, proactive approach to safeguarding
our community.


Core Elements
   1. Prevention: Actions to reduce or eliminate risks, including implementing policies,
      conducting risk assessments, and maintaining infrastructure.
   2. Mitigation: Measures to reduce the impact of unavoidable emergencies.
   3. Preparedness: Readiness through resource identification and pre-positioning, role
      assignment, testing life safety systems, training, and awareness.
   4. Response: Actions during an emergency to protect individuals, manage risks, and
      minimize disruption.
   5. Recovery: Efforts to restore the College to pre-incident conditions or better with
      continuous learning and improvement.




                                                                                                     4
Legislative Context
Ridley College’s emergency planning is informed by the Emergency Management and Civil
Protection Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. E.9), emphasizing planning, training, education, and recovery
initiatives. This alignment underscores our commitment to fostering a safe, resilient campus
environment.


Distribution
To ensure the safety, security, and effectiveness of Ridley College's Emergency Response Plan,
access to specific restricted procedures and sensitive information is limited to the following:

   1. Ridley College Board of Governors: including the Board Chair, members of the
      committee(s) responsible for crisis management, and any additional Board members
      authorized by the Chair to access the information.
   2. Executive Leadership Team Members: Includes all members as defined in the
      "Executive Strategy & Recovery" section of this plan.
   3. Emergency Response Team Members: Comprises individuals designated within the
      "Emergency Response Team Structure" who have direct responsibilities in implementing
      emergency protocols.
   4. Authorized External Agencies: Third-parties such as emergency services or professional
      consulting firms, etc.


Review and Revision
The Manager of Campus Safety and Security Services reviews the ERP annually and after any
activation to ensure its policies, procedures, and training programs are up to date and able to
address evolving challenges. The Executive Leadership Team approves major revisions.




                                                                                                  5
Definitions
Declared Emergency: An emergency formally acknowledged by the Headmaster or designate,
in consultation with the Executive Leadership Team and Incident Commander (IC), due to its
severity, complexity, or potential impact. This declaration activates the Emergency Response
Plan, mobilizing resources and coordinating response efforts.

Disaster: An event that exceeds the College’s capacity to manage with available resources
and/or one that affects the broader community, necessitating independent operation or self-
sufficiency for 72 hours or more. It includes situations that disrupt normal operations, requiring
immediate and coordinated efforts across the campus and external partners to restore safety,
services, and operations.

Emergency: As defined by the Emergency Management & Civil Protection Act (R.S.O. 1990,
c.E.9): “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions
that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is
caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether
intentional or otherwise.”

Emergency Response Team (ERT): The group responsible for responding to emergencies by
implementing protocols and coordinating response actions to ensure the safety and well-being
of all individuals involved.

First Responders: May include staff from Security, Facilities, Health Services, Residential
Boarding team, or other departments, alongside external emergency services (Police, Fire, and
Ambulance).

Incident: Any event threatening or has the potential to threaten the normal operations, safety,
or well-being of individuals or assets within the Ridley College community. Incidents can range
from minor incidents to major incidents, or disasters, requiring a coordinated response.

Incident Action Plan (IAP): A verbal or written plan outlining how a particular incident will be
managed, including objectives, strategies, and tactics. For simple incidents, the Incident
Commander (IC) may set these elements. In complex incidents, the Planning & Logistics section
is responsible for developing and maintaining the IAP in coordination with the IC.

Incident Command (IC): The functional authority within Ridley College’s emergency response
framework, holding overall responsibility for coordinating and directing all aspects of an
incident. Through Incident Command, Ridley College maintains unified control over the
emergency response to protect the safety and well-being of the entire community.
                                                                                                6
Incident Command Post (ICP): The location where the ERT oversees and manages an incident.
It should be situated outside of hazardous areas yet close enough to allow effective
coordination and command.

Incident Management System (IMS): A standardized approach to managing incidents and
disasters by utilizing facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a
common organizational structure.

Major Incident: A mid-level emergency that involves significant risks to safety or operations,
requiring coordination between multiple departments and potentially external agencies.

Minor Incident: The lowest level of emergency or disruption that is localized and manageable
and does not pose a significant risk to campus safety, operations, or the broader community.

Ridley College Community: Primarily consists of current students, parents, and employees, but
also includes alumni, donors, retirees, and others who have an official connection to the
College.

Section: An organizational level having responsibility for a functional area of incident
management (e.g., Emergency Information & Liaison, Safety & Operations, Planning & Logistics,
Finance & Administration).

Single Command: Occurs when one organization or jurisdiction is responsible for coordinating
and managing an incident.

Unified Command Structure: In rare cases when multiple incident response organizations are
involved, a shared management approach replaces a single command. In this setup, two or
more lead organizations or jurisdictions collaborate through a common set of objectives,
strategies, and tactics.




                                                                                                 7
Response Levels
The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) categorizes emergencies into three levels, Minor Incident,
Major Incident, and a Disaster, based on the severity, complexity, required resources for
response, and duration. This framework ensures a scalable, consistent approach to managing
emergencies and minimizing disruption to the campus community.

Level Criteria
The level of an emergency is determined by evaluating several factors, including:

   1. Impact: How many people, areas, or systems are affected? Is the incident localized, or
      does it have a broader impact?
   2. Severity of Risk: Does the incident pose a minor inconvenience, significant risk to safety
      or operations, or immediate life-threatening danger?
   3. Resource Requirements: Can the situation be managed with internal resources, or are
      external emergency services required?
   4. Duration of Response: Is the response short-term, requiring only hours, or prolonged,
      involving days or weeks of recovery
   5. Potential for Escalation: Could the incident grow in severity or complexity if not
      addressed promptly or if available resources are exhausted before replacements can be
      accessed?

Level 1 Minor Incident: Involves a localized and predictable situation that can be managed
using the College’s standard, planned responses. These events typically affect specific areas,
require minimal resources, and do not significantly disrupt operations.

   ●   Localized short term power outage affecting a part of a building.
   ●   Small fire in a microwave.
   ●   Vehicle breakdown off campus with students aboard.
   ●   A minor medical emergency:
          o Basic first aid for a small cut.
          o Mild symptoms like dizziness or dehydration.
          o Twisted ankle.

Level 2 Major Incident: An Incident involving an unpredictable, serious situation with
significant potential impacts on operations and/or safety. These incidents require a
coordinated response from multiple departments and possibly external agencies.


                                                                                                 8
   ● Severe weather (e.g., windstorm) causing major disruptions to campus operations for
     more than 24 hours.
   ● Fire affecting the occupancy of a building.
   ● Transportation accident with injuries.
   ● Life-threatening medical emergency:
         o Cardiac arrest.
         o Severe allergic reaction.

Level 3 Disaster: a severe event with widespread impacts on campus safety, operations, and
potentially the environment. These events demand significant resources and full coordination
with external agencies.

   ●   Tornado causing widespread damage to campus buildings and grounds.
   ●   Prolonged campus-wide power outage.
   ●   Transportation accident with fatalities.
   ●   Health crises, such as pandemics or large-scale disease outbreaks.


Activation
   1. Declaring an Emergency: The authority to officially declare an emergency rests primarily
      with the Headmaster, who consults with the Executive Leadership Team and Incident
      Commander (IC). If the Headmaster or IC is unavailable or immediate action is required,
      designated alternate ICs or members of the Executive Leadership Team may declare an
      emergency and activate the Emergency Response Plan.
   2. Incident Identification: Once an emergency is declared, the IC, in consultation with
      relevant ERT members, determines the appropriate level of activation based on the
      situation’s nature and scale.
   3. Incident Command Post (ICP): Upon activation, the IC and ERT coordinate response
      operations from the ICP, ensuring the responsibilities outlined in the Incident
      Management Structure are assigned.
   4. Incident Action Plan (IAP): The ERT develops or updates a verbal or written IAP,
      mobilizing resources as required. By following the IMS framework, Ridley College can
      escalate or scale back its emergency response as conditions change.
   5. Prioritizing Well-Being: All response activities prioritize the safety and well-being of
      students, staff, visitors, and the broader Ridley community.




                                                                                               9
Incident Management Structure
Ridley College’s emergency response structure is composed of First Responders and the

Operational Period
An operational period is a designated time frame during which specific objectives, strategies,
and tactics are planned, implemented, and evaluated in response to an incident. The Incident
Commander (IC), in coordination with the Planning & Logistics Section, determines the length
of each operational period based on the incident's scope, complexity, and evolving conditions.

Key activities:
   1. Incident Action Plan Execution: Objectives outlined in the IAP are implemented and
       monitored.
   2. Briefings: Clear communication of responsibilities and safety measures to all personnel
       at the start of each period.

Coordinator or designated facilitator, the AAR involves key stakeholders, including incident
commanders (IC), operations personnel, and support staff.

The review covers incident response objectives, decision-making processes, resource utilization,
interagency coordination, and communication effectiveness. During the review, a detailed
timeline of the incident should be established with input from stakeholders and based on notes
produced by the scribe(s) and others in real time.

The output of the AAR is a formal report that includes key findings, lessons learned, and
actionable recommendations. These findings inform updates to emergency plans, training
programs, and operational procedures, ensuring continuous improvement and enhanced
preparedness for future incidents.

The formal report shall be reviewed by the ELT.
