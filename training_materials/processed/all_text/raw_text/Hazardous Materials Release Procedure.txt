Purpose
This procedure provides direction for responding to the release of hazardous materials, either on-site or in the vicinity of the school, to ensure the safety and security of students, faculty, staff, and visitors while minimizing health risks and operational disruption.
Procedure Statement
This procedure was developed to address incidents involving hazardous materials, including toxic industrial chemicals, transport accidents, industrial spills, and on-site exposure to hazardous substances such as ammonia. It outlines response levels, communication protocols, and evacuation or shelter-in-place procedures.
Scope
This procedure applies to any situation where hazardous materials pose a potential or immediate threat to the school community, whether originating on-site or in the surrounding area. It provides a framework for decision-making regarding shelter-in-place, partial or full evacuation, and coordination with emergency services.
Emergency Response Definitions
LEVEL 1 - Localized Containment: A minor spill or exposure on campus that can be contained without a major health risk. Evacuation is limited to the affected area, and cleanup is handled by trained personnel or contracted services.

LEVEL 2 - Shelter-in-Place or Partial Evacuation: A moderate hazardous materials release in the vicinity or a controlled release on campus that requires individuals to shelter-in-place to avoid exposure. Partial evacuation may be necessary if conditions worsen.

LEVEL 3 - Full Evacuation: A severe hazardous materials incident that poses a significant threat to health and safety, requiring immediate evacuation of the entire school or campus under the direction of emergency services.

Emergency Notification Procedure
Report: Any individual witnessing or becoming aware of a hazardous materials release must immediately notify Campus Security and Facilities.
Assess: Campus Security, in coordination with Facilities, will assess the severity of the incident and consult with emergency services as needed.
Activate Response: The Manager of Campus Safety will determine the appropriate response level and implement the necessary protective actions. This can include the contracting of professional services should remediation be beyond the school’s capacity and available resources.
Communicate: If warranted, notifications will be sent via the campus emergency communication system, instructing students, staff, and faculty on shelter-in-place or evacuation procedures or to avoid specific areas.
Notifications will be sent via same and other means to indicate an all clear following remediation and declaration of emergency termination by a designated authority.
