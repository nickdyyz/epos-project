Purpose
This procedure provides direction for responding to an infectious disease case or outbreak within the school community to minimize the risk of transmission and protect students, faculty, staff, and visitors.
Procedure Statement
This procedure was developed to outline actions when a student, staff member, or visitor is identified as having a highly communicable disease such as influenza, COVID-19, measles, or another public health threat. It establishes protocols for containment, communication, and coordination with health authorities.
Scope
This procedure applies to situations where:
A student or staff member is diagnosed with a highly communicable disease.
Public health authorities notify the school of an outbreak in the community.
Unvaccinated or medically vulnerable individuals may require additional precautions.
It provides a framework for identifying cases, implementing infection control measures, and responding to public health guidance.
Emergency Response Definitions
LEVEL 1 - Enhanced Monitoring: A single case or suspected case is identified. The individual is isolated, close contacts are notified, and basic hygiene measures are reinforced.

LEVEL 2 - Containment Measures: Multiple cases are identified, or public health authorities warn of increased risk. Additional measures such as cohorting, enhanced cleaning, and potential temporary class closures are implemented.

LEVEL 3 - School-Wide Response: A significant outbreak occurs, requiring large-scale interventions such as full campus closure, remote learning, or quarantine measures based on public health directives.

Emergency Notification Procedure
Report: Any student or staff member experiencing symptoms of a known infectious disease must report to Health Services immediately.
Assess: Health Services will evaluate the individual and, if necessary, refer them for testing or treatment.
Notify: If a confirmed case is identified, the Manager of Campus Safety will notify public health authorities and the Executive Leadership Team.
Activate Response: Based on health authority recommendations, the appropriate response level will be implemented, and communication will be sent via the school’s emergency notification system.
