# Input Structuring System Documentation

## Overview

The Input Structuring System is a comprehensive solution designed to improve the accuracy of the EPOS small language model by providing structured input mapping, taxonomy, and glossary. This system ensures that user inputs are properly mapped to emergency plan elements, resulting in more relevant and accurate plan outputs.

## Key Components

### 1. Emergency Planning Taxonomy

The system implements a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes emergency planning elements into structured hierarchies:

#### Organization Types (7 categories)
- **Educational**: Universities, schools, colleges with subtypes (K-12, post-secondary, specialized)
- **Healthcare**: Hospitals, clinics, medical centers with subtypes (acute care, long-term care, outpatient)
- **Corporate**: Business offices, companies with subtypes (office, professional, technology)
- **Manufacturing**: Industrial plants, factories with subtypes (heavy industry, light industry, assembly)
- **Retail**: Stores, shopping centers with subtypes (department store, specialty retail, shopping center)
- **Government**: Public agencies with subtypes (municipal, provincial, federal)
- **Non-Profit**: Charities, community organizations with subtypes (social services, charitable, advocacy)

#### Hazards (12 categories across 3 types)
**Natural Disasters:**
- Earthquake, Flood, Severe Weather, Wildland Fire

**Technological Hazards:**
- Power Outage, Chemical Spill, Equipment Failure, Cyber Attack

**Human-Caused Hazards:**
- Workplace Violence, Medical Emergency, Transportation Accident, Infectious Disease

#### Procedures (10 categories)
- Evacuation, Communication, Security, Medical Response, Transportation, Heat Interruption, Working Alone, Hazardous Materials, Infectious Disease

#### Resources (4 categories)
- Safety Equipment, Communication Equipment, Medical Equipment, Evacuation Equipment

### 2. Emergency Planning Glossary

The system includes a comprehensive glossary with standardized terminology:

#### Core Terms
- **Emergency Plan**: A comprehensive document outlining procedures for responding to various emergency situations
- **Emergency Response**: Immediate actions taken to address an emergency situation
- **Evacuation**: The process of moving people from a dangerous area to a safe location
- **Lockdown**: A security procedure that restricts movement within a facility during a threat
- **Incident Command**: A standardized approach to emergency management and response

#### Hazard Terms
- **Natural Disaster**: Events caused by natural forces such as weather, geology, or environmental factors
- **Technological Hazard**: Events caused by human-made systems, equipment, or infrastructure failures
- **Human-Caused Hazard**: Events intentionally or unintentionally caused by human actions
- **Risk Assessment**: The process of identifying and evaluating potential hazards and their likelihood

#### Response Terms
- **Mitigation**: Actions taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of hazards
- **Preparedness**: Activities undertaken to build capabilities for effective emergency response
- **Response**: Immediate actions taken to address an emergency situation
- **Recovery**: Activities undertaken to restore normal operations after an emergency

### 3. Input Structuring System

The core system that processes and structures user inputs:

#### Input Processing Pipeline
1. **Raw Input Collection**: Gather user inputs through forms or questionnaires
2. **Input Mapping**: Map user inputs to standardized taxonomy categories
3. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs and identify missing or conflicting information
4. **Input Enrichment**: Add context and recommendations based on organization type and hazards
5. **Structured Output**: Generate structured inputs for the language model

#### Structured Input Categories
- **Organization Profile**: Basic info, characteristics, regulatory context, operational hours
- **Hazard Assessment**: Primary hazards, risk factors, response priorities, special considerations
- **Resource Inventory**: Personnel, equipment, communication systems, external resources
- **Procedural Requirements**: Plan scope, required procedures, training requirements
- **Operational Context**: Physical environment, constraints, stakeholder requirements

## Benefits for Small Language Model Accuracy

### 1. Improved Input Consistency

**Before Input Structuring:**
- Inconsistent terminology across different users
- Vague or ambiguous input descriptions
- Missing context for organization-specific requirements
- Unstructured data that confuses the language model

**After Input Structuring:**
- Standardized terminology using the glossary
- Clear, structured input format
- Rich context with organization characteristics
- Validated and enriched inputs

### 2. Enhanced Context Relevance

**Before Input Structuring:**
- Language model receives raw, unfiltered inputs
- No mapping to relevant emergency planning concepts
- Generic responses that don't address specific needs
- Inconsistent plan structure and content

**After Input Structuring:**
- Inputs are mapped to specific hazard types and procedures
- Organization-specific context is automatically included
- Relevant risk factors and response priorities are identified
- Structured prompts guide the language model to generate appropriate content

### 3. Better Plan Accuracy

**Before Input Structuring:**
- Plans may miss organization-specific requirements
- Generic procedures that don't address actual hazards
- Inconsistent terminology and structure
- Missing regulatory compliance considerations

**After Input Structuring:**
- Plans are tailored to specific organization types and hazards
- Procedures address identified risk factors and response priorities
- Consistent terminology and structure across all plans
- Regulatory requirements are automatically included

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Input Structuring System Class

```python
class InputStructuringSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.taxonomy = EMERGENCY_PLANNING_TAXONOMY
        self.glossary = EMERGENCY_PLANNING_GLOSSARY
    
    def structure_user_inputs(self, raw_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Process and structure user inputs
        # Returns structured inputs with validation and enrichment
```

### 2. Input Mapping Functions

```python
def _map_organization_type(self, org_type: str) -> str:
    # Maps user input to standardized organization type
    # Returns category like "healthcare", "educational", etc.

def _map_hazard(self, hazard: str) -> str:
    # Maps user hazard input to standardized hazard type
    # Returns category like "medical_emergency", "chemical_spill", etc.

def _identify_risk_factors(self, hazard: str) -> List[str]:
    # Identifies risk factors for specific hazards
    # Returns relevant risk factors for the hazard
```

### 3. Input Validation and Enrichment

```python
def _validate_inputs(self, structured_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Validates structured inputs and identifies issues
    # Returns validation results with warnings and recommendations

def _enrich_inputs(self, structured_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Enriches inputs with additional context and recommendations
    # Returns enriched inputs with suggestions and compliance notes
```

## Integration with Enhanced Plan Generator

### 1. Enhanced V2 Generator

The system integrates with the Enhanced Emergency Plan Generator V2:

```python
class EnhancedEmergencyPlanGeneratorV2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_structuring_system = InputStructuringSystem()
    
    def generate_plan(self, inputs: Dict) -> str:
        # Structure inputs first
        structured_inputs = self.input_structuring_system.structure_user_inputs(inputs)
        
        # Create enhanced prompt with structured inputs
        prompt = self.create_enhanced_emergency_plan_prompt(structured_inputs)
        
        # Generate plan with improved accuracy
        return self.generate_plan_with_llm(prompt)
