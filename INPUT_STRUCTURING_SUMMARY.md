## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Input Structuring System Class

```python
class InputStructuringSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.taxonomy = EMERGENCY_PLANNING_TAXONOMY
        self.glossary = EMERGENCY_PLANNING_GLOSSARY
    
    def structure_user_inputs(self, raw_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Process and structure user inputs
        # Returns structured inputs with validation and enrichment
```

### 2. Key Mapping Functions

```python
def _map_organization_type(self, org_type: str) -> str:
    # Maps "Healthcare Facility" → "healthcare"
    # Maps "Educational Institution" → "educational"

def _map_hazard(self, hazard: str) -> str:
    # Maps "Medical Emergency" → "medical_emergency"
    # Maps "Chemical Spill" → "chemical_spill"

def _identify_risk_factors(self, hazard: str) -> List[str]:
    # Returns relevant risk factors for specific hazards

def _identify_response_priorities(self, hazard: str) -> List[str]:
    # Returns response priorities for specific hazards
```

### 3. Validation and Enrichment

```python
def _validate_inputs(self, structured_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Validates inputs and provides warnings/recommendations

def _enrich_inputs(self, structured_inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Adds context, suggestions, and compliance requirements
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements
