# Enhanced EPOS System Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Emergency Plan Organization System (EPOS) has been significantly improved through intelligent document organization and targeted context selection. This enhancement provides more accurate and relevant emergency plan generation by categorizing training materials and selecting context based on specific organizational needs.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Document Organization System

The system now organizes the 14 emergency management documents into four main categories:

#### A. Hazards (12 categories)
- **Natural Hazards**: earthquake, flood, fire, severe_weather, power_outage
- **Technological Hazards**: chemical_spill, cyber_attack, equipment_failure
- **Human-Caused Hazards**: workplace_violence, medical_emergency, transportation_accident, infectious_disease

#### B. Organization Types (7 categories)
- **Educational**: 11 documents (universities, schools, colleges)
- **Healthcare**: 10 documents (hospitals, medical facilities)
- **Corporate**: 9 documents (business offices, companies)
- **Government**: 9 documents (municipal, provincial, federal agencies)
- **Industrial**: 6 documents (manufacturing plants, factories)
- **Retail**: 8 documents (stores, commercial spaces)
- **Non-Profit**: 7 documents (charities, volunteer organizations)

#### C. Procedures (10 categories)
- **Evacuation**: 10 documents
- **Communication**: 14 documents
- **Security**: 13 documents
- **Transportation**: 10 documents
- **Medical Response**: 6 documents
- **Working Alone**: 1 document
- **Heat Interruption**: 5 documents
- **Hazardous Materials**: 7 documents
- **Infectious Disease**: 6 documents

#### D. Comprehensive Plans (2 categories)
- **Healthcare**: 5 documents
- **Educational**: 3 documents

### 2. Intelligent Context Selection

The enhanced system selects relevant documents based on:

1. **Organization Type Matching**: Automatically selects documents relevant to the organization's sector
2. **Hazard-Specific Content**: Chooses documents that address the specific hazards identified
3. **Procedure Relevance**: Includes documents with relevant emergency procedures
4. **Duplicate Elimination**: Removes duplicate documents to optimize context length

### 3. Improved Plan Accuracy

#### Before Enhancement
- Used all 14 documents indiscriminately
- Context was not tailored to specific needs
- Potential for irrelevant information to dilute quality
- Longer processing times due to excessive context

#### After Enhancement
- Uses only relevant documents (typically 3-8 documents)
- Context is specifically tailored to organization type and hazards
- Higher quality, more focused plan generation
- Faster processing with optimized context

- **Healthcare**: 10 documents
- **Corporate**: 9 documents
- **Government**: 9 documents
- **Retail**: 8 documents
- **Non-Profit**: 7 documents
- **Industrial**: 6 documents

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Document Organizer (`document_organizer.py`)

```python
class DocumentOrganizer:
    def categorize_documents(self) -> Dict:
        # Analyzes and categorizes all documents
        # Returns organized structure by type, hazards, procedures
    
    def get_relevant_context(self, organization_type: str, hazards: List[str]) -> str:
        # Selects relevant documents based on organization needs
        # Returns optimized context for plan generation
```

### 2. Enhanced Plan Generator (`enhanced_emergency_plan_generator.py`)

```python
class EnhancedEmergencyPlanGenerator:
    def get_relevant_context(self, organization_type: str, hazards: List[str]) -> str:
        # Maps organization types and hazards to document categories
        # Returns targeted context for improved accuracy
    
    def create_enhanced_emergency_plan_prompt(self, inputs: Dict) -> str:
        # Creates prompts with organized, relevant context
        # Improves plan quality and relevance
```

### 3. API Integration

The web API (`plan_generation_api.py`) now uses the enhanced generator:

```python
# Initialize the enhanced plan generator
generator = EnhancedEmergencyPlanGenerator()
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Educational Institution with Fire and Medical Hazards

**Input:**
- Organization Type: Educational Institution
- Hazards: Fire, Medical Emergency
- Location: Vancouver, BC

**Context Selection:**
- Comprehensive Plans: Educational (3 documents)
- Organization Types: Educational (11 documents)
- Hazards: Fire (10 documents), Medical Emergency (7 documents)
- **Total Relevant Documents**: ~8-12 (after deduplication)

### Example 2: Healthcare Facility with Chemical Spill and Infectious Disease

**Input:**
- Organization Type: Healthcare Facility
- Hazards: Chemical Spill, Infectious Disease
- Location: Toronto, ON

**Context Selection:**
- Comprehensive Plans: Healthcare (5 documents)
- Organization Types: Healthcare (10 documents)
- Hazards: Chemical Spill (7 documents), Infectious Disease (7 documents)
- Procedures: Medical Response (6 documents), Infectious Disease (6 documents)
- **Total Relevant Documents**: ~10-15 (after deduplication)
